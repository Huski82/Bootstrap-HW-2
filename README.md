# Bootstrap-HW-2
Template on basic layout using Bootstrap, HTML and CSS
Made a functional, deployed application.
Made sure to have notes in HTML files breaking down every step I did to make each page, (Navbar, Responsiveness, Grid, Column, etc.)
Made navbar using jquery and made sure to have code at the bottom of each HTML page.
The About Me, Portfolio, and Contact page all linked properly
Made and attempted to have a sticky footer
Committed about 4 times.
I attempted to make buttons but they do not link to anything.
